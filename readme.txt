You use your own keys to send your backuped data to your application at Amazon S3 secure Cloud.
We know, that Amazon S3 is secure by default. Only owners of the buckets and objects have access to Amazon S3 backup they had created. Amazon S3 Backup & Restore plugin supports user authentication to control access to backup data. You can use access with own keys to securely Restore or Backup your data to/from Amazon S3 via SSL endpoints using the HTTPS protocol. If you need extra security you can use the Server Side Encryption (SSE) option on Amazon or the Server Side Encryption with Customer-Provide Keys (SSE-C) option to encrypt data stored-at-rest. Amazon S3 provides the encryption technology for both SSE and SSE-C for your backup and other data stored at Amazon S3 Cloud. Alternatively you can use your own encryption libraries to encrypt data before storing backup in Amazon S3.
